- [x] Function that fetches current weather data for a given location using OpenWeatherAPI (key stored in .env)

- [x] Create data model based on the weather data, visualize it in mermaid diagram, and then create it in SQLite
- [x] Function that takes fetched weather data and upserts it to SQLite
- [x] Add 1-3 simple tests for the upsert functionality
- [x] Visualize the current weather data in Streamlit appropriately
- [x] Allow users to input desired location in Streamlit and have it fetch for that query (and store in SQLite ofcourse)
- [x] Visualize the SQLite table(s) somewhere in Streamlit as well
