I would like your help to build a quick weather API-pipeline with data visualization that uses OpenWeatherAPI, SQLite, and Streamlit, primarily.

User should be able to input desired location in streamlit and have weather for that location visualized in a nice way.

Please check the @todo-list.md and start with the first task, and boilerplate/layout if needed

almost perfect, just small issues, the historical data doesnt seem to update (or is that due to incrementality? since its the same day), and i get this error about streamlit not having a attribute "experimental_rerun":
